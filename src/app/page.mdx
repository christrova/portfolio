I’m a software engineer with a strong passion for entrepreneurship. Driven by ambition and clear goals, I firmly believe in continuous improvement.

I follow a process I call **"plus 0.00…01 every day at least"** meaning that it's essential to make progress daily, even if it's just a small step. Every day, I challenge myself to update my mindset, ensuring I never stay stagnant. I learn from my interactions with others and the challenges I face. For me, difficulties are growth catalysts: I become a better version of myself by overcoming obstacles.

After two years of preparatory classes for top engineering schools, I joined ECE's engineering program. This is where my vision evolved, and I quickly developed a passion for technology and computer science.

## My Development Process

In both my personal and technical development, I constantly strive to improve by listening to others and reflecting on each day. On the technical side, I focus on projects that present real challenges, requiring both teamwork and autonomy. School has taught me how to learn, which pushes me to explore new concepts and tools daily.

Since 2022, my goal has been to become as skilled technically as I am personally in the field of information systems. My long-term ambition is to contribute to companies with significant technological and environmental impact.

## My Philosophy

I am deeply committed to continuous growth, both technically and personally. Each new skill I acquire opens up new opportunities and helps me grow, both professionally and personally. I find true satisfaction in this ongoing process of learning and self-improvement.

## My Technical Spectrum

For me, programming is a way to communicate with machines to solve specific human needs. I have learned several languages and technologies through various personal and professional projects.

Here are some of the technical skills I've developed so far:

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, SQL, PostgreSQL
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Microservices, iOS/Android App Development, Agile

Currently, I am deepening my knowledge with a focus on **Cloud Engineering**, specifically:

- DevOps / Containers & Orchestration
- Microservices Architectures
- Cloud Strategies
- Infra CSP (Cloud Service Providers)

## My Passions

Outside of my studies and projects, I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I particularly love strategy games like chess♟️, team games, and coding, which has become a true passion of mine.
